                    <p>Topps makes great use of whitespace to display the items that they have for sale.
                        The whitespace is also used to break up the different sections of their homepage. 
                        I quite enjoy the clean look and find it easy to navigate the site.</p>

                    <p>The church website uses Visual Hierarchy to draw the reader to the most important or latest articles
                        that are published to the website. Any new announcements are displayed with an eyecatching color at
                        the top of the page. I find it really easy to see what they would like me to focus on when I visit the site.</p>

                    <p>The NFL website makes use of Fitt's law by making their buttons easily seen and accessible.
                        As I navigate through the site, I know where I need to press to look at an article or access another
                        page on their site. I know what images are videos by the display of a play symbol in the middle of the 
                        image.</p>
